dialog --title "Installation Complete" --msgbox "To access desktop mode:

1. In EmulationStation, go to Main Menu → System Settings → Services and toggle ON the Windowed service. Make sure to press Back to save.

2. Press F1 — you should see a windowed PCManFM file manager.

3. In /userdata/desktop, launch one of the desktop environment scripts (this can take a while).

To revert back to fullscreen mode:
- Simply toggle the Windowed service OFF and reboot to apply fullscreen layout.

NOTE:
Some Chromium based apps that require --no-sandbox as root (like Google Chrome) should be launched from Batocera's PCManFM inside /userdata/roms/conty instead of using desktop icons or menus." 20 90
